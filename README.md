## Branching Strategy

Each Project will have a remote `Main` branch on Github and a `Development` branch locally with `Feature` and `BugFix` branches branching out from it.

## .Gitignore

.gitignore is used by git and Github to identify files that should be ignored by git commands.

This allows some files to not be pushed along with other files in the repo.

This can be used to ignore credentials in .env files or configuration files in different environments.
